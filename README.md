Notes, tradeoffs, and follow‑ups
- Design fidelity: The hero, navbar, and key sections were matched to the selected Figma frames (desktop and mobile). If you spot pixel differences at specific widths (e.g., 1440 or 393), we can fine‑tune line heights, letter spacing, or offsets.
- Accessibility: Color contrast follows design; next steps would include keyboard focus outlines for CTAs and aria labels for decorative imagery.
- Performance: Heavy shadows and large images can be optimized (preloading hero background, adding width/height attributes, compressing PNGs, switching to webp when possible).
